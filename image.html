      <img src="amazon.jpg" alt="Image 1">
      <p class="description">The Amazon Rainforest, also known as the "Lungs of the Earth,"
         is the world's largest tropical rainforest, spanning over 5.5 million 
         square kilometers across nine countries in South America. It is home to an incredible
          diversity of wildlife, including millions of species of plants, animals, and insects,
           many of which are found nowhere else. The Amazon plays a crucial role in regulating global
            climate by absorbing vast amounts of carbon dioxide. However, deforestation and climate change 
            threaten its delicate ecosystems, endangering countless species and impacting indigenous communities 
            who depend on the forest for their livelihoods.</p>
